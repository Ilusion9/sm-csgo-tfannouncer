# Description
Players will be announced when teammates flashes them. Admins can be informed as well.

Add "TeamFlashAnnouncer" override in admin_overrides.cfg, so only players with specific flag can be announced about who flashed them.

Add "TeamFlashAnnouncerAdmin" override in admin_overrides.cfg to change the permissions for admins which can see who flashed whom.
